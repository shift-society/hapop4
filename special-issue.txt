Computing and programming in context
====================================

Call for Papers for Philosophy and Technology’s special issue on 
Computing and programming in context – The interplay between logic, 
science, technology and society.

Introduction
------------

In a society where computers have become ubiquitous, it is necessary 
to develop a broader understanding of the nature of computing and 
programming, not just from a technical viewpoint, but also from a 
historical and philosophical perspective. Computers and computer 
programs do not exist in a vacuum – they are a part of a rich 
socio-technological context that provides ways for understanding 
computers and reasoning about programs (cognitive sciences and logic), 
they are made of technology that shapes the nature of computing and 
programming. Computers and programs also influence our understanding 
of the world (e.g. as a scientific instrument) or our relationship 
with the world (i.e. their sociological and psychological effects). 

The aim of this special issue is to bring together works exploring 
computing and programming across their rich socio-technological, 
scientific and formal context. We are convinced that an 
inter-disciplinary approach is necessary for understanding computing 
and programming in their multifaceted nature. As such, we welcome 
interdisciplinary submissions by researchers coming from a diversity 
of backgrounds, including historians, philosophers and computer 
scientists. 

Questions that consider computing and programming in a wider 
context include, for example: 

 * What formal, societal and technological influences contributed to 
   the way in which modern programs are written and modern 
   computers are constructed? 
   
 * In what ways can computer programs lead to novel phenomenological 
   experiences, be it through direct engagement with technological 
   artifacts or as mediated through art? 
   
 * What is the role of programs and computer simulations in 
   traditional sciences such as biology and physics?

This special issue follows two recent events organised by the 
Commission for the History and Philosophy of Computing – the Fourth 
Conference on the History and Philosophy of Computing (HaPoC, Brno, 
October 2017) and the Fourth Symposium on the History and Philosophy 
of Programming (HaPoP, Oxford, April 2018). This call is open both 
to authors of contributions to HaPoC and HaPoP who are encouraged 
to submit a full paper based on their presentations, and to 
submissions not presented at the aforementioned conferences.

Topic
----- 

This Call for Papers invites work that contributes to philosophy of 
technology by engaging with questions that arise when we consider 
computing and programming in a wider context. This includes, but is 
not limited to the interplay between computing or programming and:

 * Mathematics and formal logics – What role have mathematics and 
   formal logics played in the history of computing and programming? 
   What is the nature of the relationship between computer programs 
   or technical computing artifacts and their formal models?
   
 * Sciences – Does computing and programming provide qualitatively 
   new methods in sciences such as physics or biology? What can we 
   learn by tracing the interaction between computing and scientific
   knowledge through the history?
   
 * Technology – In what ways have technological innovations enabled 
   developments in computing and programming? What is the nature of 
   the technological artifacts used in computing and how does it 
   differ from other areas of technology?
   
 * Society – What are the societal implications of computing and 
   programming? How are developments in computing interlinked with 
   activities of professional organisations or businesses? How does 
   programming contribute to disciplines outside of a narrow 
   business programming context in areas such as art?

Submission details
------------------

To submit a paper for this special issue, authors should go to the 
journal’s Editorial Manager http://www.editorialmanager.com/phte/  
The author (or a corresponding author for each submission in case 
of co-authored papers) must register into EM. The author must then 
select the special article type: "COMPUTING AND PROGRAMMING IN 
CONTEXT" from the selection provided in the submission process. 
This is needed in order to assign the submissions to the Guest Editors.  

Submissions will then be assessed according to the following procedure:  
New Submission => Journal Editorial Office => Guest Editor(s) => 
Reviewers => Reviewers’ Recommendations => Guest Editor(s)’ 
Recommendation => Editor-in-Chief’s Final Decision => Author 
Notification of the Decision. The process will be reiterated in 
case of requests for revisions.

Philosophy & Technology
-----------------------

Editor-in-Chief: Luciano Floridi (Oxford)

The journal addresses the expanding scope and unprecedented impact 
of technologies, in order to improve the critical understanding of 
the conceptual nature and practical consequences, and hence provide 
the conceptual foundations for their fruitful and sustainable 
developments. The journal welcomes high-quality submissions, 
regardless of the tradition, school of thought or disciplinary 
background from which they derive.
