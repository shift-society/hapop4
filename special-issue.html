        <p>In a society where computers have become ubiquitous, it is necessary to develop a broader 
          understanding of the nature of computing and programming, not just from a technical viewpoint, 
          but also from a historical and philosophical perspective. Computers and computer programs do 
          not exist in a vacuum – they are a part of a rich socio-technological context that provides 
          ways for understanding computers and reasoning about programs (cognitive sciences and logic), 
          they are made of technology that shapes the nature of computing and programming. Computers and 
          programs also influence our understanding of the world (e.g. as a scientific instrument) or 
          our relationship with the world (i.e. their sociological and psychological effects). </p>

        <p>The aim of this special issue is to bring together works exploring computing and programming 
          across their rich socio-technological, scientific and formal context. We are convinced that an 
          inter-disciplinary approach is necessary for understanding computing and programming in their 
          multifaceted nature. As such, we welcome interdisciplinary submissions by researchers coming 
          from a diversity of backgrounds, including historians, philosophers and computer scientists. </p>

        <p>Questions that consider computing and programming in a wider context include: </p>

        <ul>
          <li>What formal, societal and technological influences contributed to the way in which
             modern programs are written and modern computers are constructed? </li>
          <li>In what ways can computer programs lead to novel phenomenological experiences, be
             it through direct engagement with technological artifacts or as mediated through art? </li>
          <li>What is the role of programs and computer simulations in traditional sciences such
             as biology and physics?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Suitable submission topics</h3>
        <p>This Call for Papers invites work that contributes to philosophy of technology by engaging 
          with questions that arise when we consider computing and programming in a wider context. 
          This includes, but is not limited to the interplay between computing or programming and:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Mathematics and formal logics</strong> - What role have mathematics and formal logics played 
          in the history of computing and programming? What is the nature of the 
          relationship between computer programs or technical computing artifacts and their formal models?</li>
        <li><strong>Sciences</strong> - Does computing and programming provide qualitatively new methods 
          in sciences such as physics or biology? What can we learn by tracing 
          the interaction between computing and scientific knowledge through the history?</li>
        <li><strong>Technology</strong> - In what ways have technological innovations enabled developments 
          in computing and programming? What is the nature of the technological artifacts used 
          in computing and how does it differ from other areas of technology?</li>
        <li><strong>Society</strong> - What are the societal implications of computing and 
          programming? How are developments in computing interlinked with activities of professional organisations or 
          businesses? How does programming contribute to disciplines outside of a narrow business programming context in areas such as art?</li>
        </ul>
